## Hello 👋

I’m Liu Xuecheng, an audio algorithm engineer with a focus on speech understanding, acoustic perception, and array signal processing.

Currently, I work as a senior audio algorithm engineer at a tech company, where I lead the design and development of multimodal speech interaction architectures and train speech large language models (SpeechLLMs).

In my free time, I build AI Agent projects and share my technical thoughts on this blog.
